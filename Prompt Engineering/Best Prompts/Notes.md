# Directory Notes

The purpose of this folder is to create a repository of your most successful prompts.

As you get better at prompting, your prompts may become more elaborate.

If you're using a collaborative Markdown editor, shared folders like this can become amazing internal resources allowing multiple team members working on GPTs to "debug" one another's prompts or pool together their most successful ones.
