# GPT Workspace Folder Structure

This Github folder contains a skeleton/model for a folder structure that I have been developing and using for logging custom GPTs / GPT agents that I have been developing. 

I've included the skeleton folder structure that I have been working with and in each file detailed some notes about the  particulars that I find it helpful to record for individual GPTs.

Note: this folder structure is in a state of ongoing improvement and flux as I find better ways to iterate progressively more effective custom GPTs for concrete tasks.
