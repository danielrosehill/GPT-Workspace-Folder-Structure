## The Idea

A summary of the idea for a custom GPT / GPT agent that you're thinking about

## Purpose

You might wish to include some data to help to organise the idea, especially if you're coming up with a lot of them and storing the ideas in a shared/collaborative system.

I like to use a checkbox or database table to quickly distinguish between GPTs I'm developing for personal and business use-cases. Because there's often some overlap, I tend to find multiselects the most useful:

- [ ] Personal GPT
- [ ] Work GPT
- [ ] Hobby GPT

GPT purpose:

- [ ] Communications
- [ ] Admin
- [ ] Organisation
- [ ] Data discovery 
- [ ] Automated data analysis

## Target Platform

What platform are you thinking about using for developing this GPT.

You could include a checklist for easy re-use, like:

- [ ] ChatGPT
- [ ] Botpress
- [ ] Custom Python script

Etc

## Draft Configuration Text

A section you could use to jot down some quick ideas for configuring the custom GPT. You could develop these later by yourself or collaboratively.
